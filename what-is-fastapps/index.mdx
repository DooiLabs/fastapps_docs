FastApps is the most effective and fast way to build Apps in ChatGPT, utilizing the FastMCP framework specialized for the apps sdk.

Here's a simple Hello World widget to show how easy it is:

**Python Backend** (`server/tools/hello_tool.py`)

```python
from fastapps import BaseWidget, Field
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloInput(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(default="World", description="Name to greet")

class HelloTool(BaseWidget):
    identifier = "hello"
    title = "Hello Widget"
    input_schema = HelloInput
    
    async def execute(self, input_data: HelloInput):
        return {
            "message": f"Hello, {input_data.name}!",
            "emoji": "ðŸ‘‹"
        }
```

**React Frontend** (`widgets/hello/index.jsx`)

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useWidgetProps } from 'fastapps';

export default function HelloWidget() {
  const props = useWidgetProps();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Features

FastApps provides everything you need to build sophisticated ChatGPT apps:

**Widget Registration**: Use the `BaseWidget` class to simply register it as an MCP tool. We handle the rest - no complex configuration or manual registration needed.

**CLI commands**: Just type `fastapps init` to set up the whole project. Use `fastapps create mywidget` to make an widget. Everything from component creation to MCP tool registeration will be set up automatically.

**Simple auth**: Authentication and other advanced features are all handled with our simple decorators. Just add `@auth_required` and you're done.

## Solutions We Provide

FastApps solves the three biggest challenges in building ChatGPT apps:

**Complex setup**: Traditional approaches require extensive boilerplate, manual registration, and complex build systems. FastApps eliminates all of this with a simple two-file structure and automatic discovery.

**State management**: Managing persistent state across ChatGPT sessions is complex. We've transformed OpenAI's Apps SDK functions into a clean library. Simply import and use hooks like `useWidgetProps()`, `useWidgetState()`, and `useOpenAiGlobal()` without dealing with the raw SDK complexity.

**API integration**: Connecting to external APIs while handling security policies and data flow is challenging. FastApps handles CSP configuration and provides a clean data flow from Python to React.
