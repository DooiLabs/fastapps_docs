title: "Deploy FastApps Server"
description: "Deploy your first FastApps server using FastApps Cloud commands."
---

## Quick Start

Deploying your FastApps server to production is simple:

```bash
fastapps cloud deploy
```

That's it! The CLI will guide you through the entire process.

---

## What Happens During Deployment

When you run `fastapps cloud deploy`, here's what happens automatically:

### 1. **Project Validation**
The CLI validates your project structure to ensure all required files exist:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `server/` directory with `main.py`
- `widgets/` directory with your widget code

### 2. **Widget Build**
If your `assets/` directory doesn't exist or is outdated, you'll be prompted:

```
⚠️  Assets directory not found
Press Enter to confirm (default: yes)
Build widgets now? (Y/n):
```

Just press **Enter** to build automatically. The CLI runs `npm run build` to compile your React widgets into optimized HTML bundles.

### 3. **Authentication Check**
If you haven't logged in yet, you'll be prompted to authenticate:

```bash
fastapps cloud login
```

This opens your browser for secure OAuth authentication with FastApps Team.

### 4. **Project Selection**

If this is your first deployment from this directory, you'll see:

```
⚠️  No project linked to this directory

1. Create new project
2. Link to existing project

Choose [1-2]:
```

**Option 1: Create New Project**

You'll be asked to provide a project slug (URL-friendly identifier):

```
Project slug requirements:
  • Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
  • 3-63 characters long
  • Must start and end with letter or number

Project slug [my-app-a1b2]:
```

The CLI auto-suggests a slug based on your directory name. Just press Enter to accept, or type your own.

**Option 2: Link to Existing Project**

Select from your existing FastApps Cloud projects to deploy updates.
This will automatically happen on subsequent deployments from the same directory.

### 5. **Deployment Summary**

Before deploying, you'll see a summary:

```
Deployment Summary
 Project     my-app-a1b2
 Project ID  6fd19c55-319a-45ce-ab05-d9b39f5569b3
 Widgets     1
 Server      https://cloud-api.dooi.app

Press Enter to confirm (default: yes)
Deploy to FastApps Cloud? (Y/n):
```

Press **Enter** to continue.

### 6. **Package & Deploy**

The CLI packages your app and deploys it securely:

```
Packaging deployment artifacts...
✓ Package created (0.09 MB)

Deploying to FastApps Cloud...
⠋ Deploying safely...
```

Your code is:
- Compressed into a secure tarball
- Uploaded to FastApps Cloud via encrypted connection
- Deployed to Vercel's serverless infrastructure
- Assigned a custom `*.dooi.app` subdomain

### 7. **Success!**

Once deployed, you'll see your live URL:

```
🚀 Deployment Complete

Your app is live at:
https://my-app-a1b2.dooi.app

Deployment ID: dep_abc123
Project: my-app-a1b2 (6fd19c55-319a-45ce-ab05-d9b39f5569b3)

Test endpoints:
  • https://my-app-a1b2.dooi.app/
```

## Quick Deployment Flags

Skip confirmations and build steps with optional flags:

```bash
# Skip all confirmation prompts (auto-confirm with 'yes')
fastapps cloud deploy --yes

# Skip widget build step (use existing assets/)
fastapps cloud deploy --no-build

# Deploy to specific project (override linked project)
fastapps cloud deploy --project-id my-app

# Combine flags
fastapps cloud deploy --yes --no-build
```

---

## Understanding Project Slugs

A **project slug** is a URL-friendly identifier for your project:

✅ **Valid slugs:**
- `my-app`
- `todo-app-2024`
- `user-dashboard`
- `api-v2`

❌ **Invalid slugs:**
- `My App` (no spaces)
- `my_app` (no underscores)
- `my-app-` (can't end with hyphen)
- `-my-app` (can't start with hyphen)
- `ab` (too short, min 3 characters)

The CLI automatically converts your input to a valid slug:
- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces spaces/underscores with hyphens
- Removes invalid characters

## Deployment Lifecycle

### First Deployment
1. Create project (gets assigned a unique ID)
2. Directory is automatically linked to project
3. App is deployed and assigned `*.dooi.app` subdomain

### Subsequent Deployments
1. CLI detects linked project
2. Deploys update to same project
3. Domain remains unchanged
4. Zero-downtime deployment

### Cleanup
After deployment completes (success or failure), the CLI automatically:
- Deletes temporary build artifacts
- Cleans up the packaged tarball
- Even if you cancel (Ctrl+C), cleanup happens. no worries!
