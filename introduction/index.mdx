## Technical architecture of Apps SDK


At its core, a ChatGPT app is an MCP server that exposes multiple tools. Each tools return structured contents including a widget.

Specifically, each tools include
- Metadata : Description of the tool (so that the model could call the right tool at the right time), input schema, the message to be displayed before/after the tool is executed, etc.
- Widgets : This is the component that is being displayed on the screen.
